**A B C...It's Easy As....NVM**

Writing script for a webpage may not be easy but it does add more structure and more fancy stuff to your webpage

Before you get into Javascript you have to understand how it fits in with HTML and CSS..

There are always the three languages to create one webpage:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript

 you have your content layer: Html

 the presentation layer: CSS

 and the behavior layer: JavaScript

 Each forms a seperate layer and presents a different purpose and they each build on eachother.

 So, JavaScript is written in plain text, just like the HTML and CSS. In order to us JavaScript you have to link the file for JavaScript to your HTML page using < script > element to tell the browser, "HEY! I'm walking here!!" (jaywalking across script that is...)

 JavaScript runs where it is found in HTML....
  - For Example: If you place the script between the headers, it will only show up in the header...

  You want to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. (like HTML and CSS)

  if you view the source code in any page in a browser you will notice the JavaScript does not change the HTML. It works with the model of the webpage.

**Variables**

A script will temporarily store bits of info that it needs and it needs a place to do so. So, it stores it in variables.

***you have to make sure every line of code and every.single.step is closely monitored and every detail is correct. PAY ATTENTION!!!***

(please..)

Variable is a genius name for the concept because this data stored can *vary* each time the script is ran.

Steps to use variables:
 - Declare them

 once it is declared:

 - Assign a value

 Data Types:
  - Numeric
  - String
  - Boolean

  To store a String you use a variable and using double quotes or single quotes don't matter, but...PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL!!

  Boolean is for True or False

  Numeric is for numbers...

 Rules to follow when naming variables:
  - Must begin with a letter, a $, or an _.
  - you do not use a dash or period
  - You can not use keywords or reserved words.
  - Variables are case sensitive
  - Use a name to describe the info it stores.
  - If the variable is more than one word you must capitolize the word AFTER the first one: userName...
