Css associates style with the rules of HTML.

CSS effects how elements are displayed.

External CSS is used on the outside of a HTML folder.

Internal CSS is used on the inside of the HTML folder.

CSS selectors allow you to target rules from specific elements in HTML.

*Most are case sensitive, so they need to match element names and attributes to a T!*

**CSS Selectors**
 - Universal
 - Type
 - Class
 - ID
 - Child
 - Descendant
 - Adjacent Sibling
 - General Sibling

CSS treats each HTML element as if it shows up inside its own box and has rules in place to indicate how the element should look.

Declarations have two parts
 - things in the element you want to change
 - and values for those elements.
