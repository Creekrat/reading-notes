**CSS**

Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is the decoration of your webpage.(makes it look pretty and sometimes proffesional! :D)

Examples of styles
 - Boxes
   - this includes, Width and height, borders(color, width, and style)
   - Background color and images
   - position in the browser window

 - Text
   - typeface
   - size
   - color
   - italics, bold, uppercase, lowercase, and small-caps.

 - Specific
   - Style elements such as lists, tables, and forms.

Css associates style with the rules of HTML.

CSS effects how elements are displayed.

External CSS is used on the outside of a HTML folder.

Internal CSS is used on the inside of the HTML folder.

CSS selectors allow you to target rules from specific elements in HTML.

*Most are case sensitive, so they need to match element names and attributes to a T!*

**CSS Selectors**
 - Universal
 - Type
 - Class
 - ID
 - Child
 - Descendant
 - Adjacent Sibling
 - General Sibling

CSS treats each HTML element as if it shows up inside its own box and has rules in place to indicate how the element should look.

Declarations have two parts
 - things in the element you want to change
 - and values for those elements.

 **Colors of the WIIIIND!(I mean Wheel....)**

  You can change the colors of your website, text, background, and all sorts of things by using three types of code:
   - RGB Values
   - Hex Codes
   - Color Names (pretty basic...)

Also, think about how you want the color to look...

do you want more of a HUE?

or Saturated?

or Bright as all get out?

Play around with it and use different combinations on your webpage to make your webpage look pretty (or just one big paint blob...)

Color helps to convey the mood and draw the eye to certain places of your webpage.

Find the right color picker to help you choose the best colors.

Also to indicate opacity use RGBA or the opacity value use HSLA.

*Be mindful of the amount of contrast between any text and background. Visitors may not be able to read your content.*
