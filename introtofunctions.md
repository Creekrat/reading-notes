**JavaScript in Programming**

Intro + Scripts
 - Pgs. 1-24

 Javascript can make webpages more interactive. For Exmple:
  - Accessing content
  - Modifying the content
  - Program rules (specify a set of steps for the browser to take) 
  - Reacting to events

   JavaScript lets you make webpages more interactive by accessing and modifying content using markup used in a webpage, while it is being viewed in the browser.

   Examples of JavaScript in a browser:
    - Slideshows
    - Forms
    - Reloading parts of pages
    - Filtering data

    What is a Script?

    Well, it is a series of instructions that a computer follows to complete it's goal. (Like you in this class....Follow the instructions step by step and your outcome will be flashy and fantastic.....)

    A script is known by many names like:
    - a recipe book
    - handbooks
    - manuals
    - or even our textbook is a script..

    A browser uses different parts of scripts depending on the user and how they want to play with a webpage...

    They run different sections of code depending on the situation around them.

    When you write a script first think of your goal and then list tasks that need to be done in order (VIVID DETAIL)to achieve this goal

    Start with a big picture.....Then break it down into the tiny tiny pixels.
    (or just make sure each step you take is very detailed....again)

     - Define your goal- like a puzzle your computer has to solve
     - Design your script- use a flowchart to goal out your series of tasks.
     - CODE EACH STEP- writing the code in a coding language the computer understands and make it detailed (again...)

     Each script you make comes with its Tasks and Steps the computer must follow.
     Tasks being checking each box for a certain toy....if the toy isnt there move to the next box but if the toy is there take it and move to the next toy to find or the next box if THAT toy isnt there and so on and so forth.

     Steps literally being:
      - Step 1: open the toy box
      - Step 2: locate certain toy
      - Step 3: grab the toy
      and so on and so forth....

      make sure each step for every task is written in a language the computer understands from the Vocabulary(words the computer understands) to the Syntax(how you put those words together and create instructions for your computer)

      *Don't think like a human anymore........This world belongs to the computer now.....*


      Think about how you want to design your script and the different typs of script you need to use then sketch out the details, tasks, and steps onto a flowchart.



      **Expressions and Operators**
      Pages: 74-79

      Expressions evaluate into a single value.

      The are two types of Expressions:
      - Ones that just assign a value to a variable
      - Ones that use two or more values to return to a single value.

      Expressions rely on Operators to create a single value from one or more values.

      5 types of Operators programmers can use for this:
      - Assignment 
      - Arithmetic ( >O< Math?!)
      - String
      - Comparison
      - Logical

      There are many Arithmetic Operators and don't worry they aren't too scary.....maybe

       - (+  Add
       - (-  Subtract
       - (/  Division
       - (*  Multiply
       - (++  Increment
       - (--  Decrement
       - (%  Modulus

       (See now was that so hard?)

       Make sure you know the order of exectution
       Multiply and Divide come before Adding and Subtracting

       But what ever you want done first can be placed into parentheses and the computer will do that first instead.

       And String

       String has only one operator

        - +
        USed to join things on either side of the string. and joining two or more strings is called a *Concatenation*

        now numbers get a little funky...

        a number becomes a string when in quotes, but put one number into quotes and the other not into quotes you messed somthing up. Now with that said, a number added to a string becomes a part of that string...



        **Functions**

        Functions let you group a series of statements together to preform a task.

        You can wrap specific codes into a function so it doesn't have to be repeated and it can be used anywhere.

        Declare a function using the Function *Keyword* then give the function a name followed by parenthesis. Now the statementd that perform these sit in a code block within curly brackets.


        now you must declare a function first before calling it but once it is declared you call a function by executing the statements.

        Now some functions must run with specific tasks in mind.

        If this is the case indicate what the function needs in the parenthesis after the function name. These items are known as Parameters of a function.

        Now don't get Parameters confused with Arguments. They may be alike in some ways but they have their subtle difference: 

        particular details or numeracle variables are arguments and the parameters are just the names of variables within functions.

        Some functions return info to the code that called them. Lke a calculator.
