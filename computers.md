**How computers work**

My top 3 takes from reading

fun fact:

**they used to be wood and metal?!**

Number one:

Computers run the same way no matter what system you are on.
 - Take Input
 - Store it
 - Process it
 - Then outputs results

 Input tells the computer what to do. This can be done through input devices like:
  - Keyboards
  - Sensors
  - And even game controllers!

  Once  it is recieved through input it goes back and forth though Storage and Processing with series of commands called *Algorithms*:
  - Binary code is used for this through the memory and cpu of the computer. The computer reads stuff like this in an instant!

Once that step is finished it is time for the Output:
 - Screens
 - Cars
 - Printers
 - and Sounds are just a few

Number 2:

Binary is 1's and 0's

it is the basic form of software and people barely use it anymore.

Now basic coding languages are used

Cpu is the master chip- it knows which circuits to use and how to use them which is fascinating

The operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of the computer.


Number 3:

All things we use on computers now are being run with Binary code.
 - Text: each letter is defined with binary code.
 - Images: have pixels, that have colors, that are filled with numbers, and you get binary!
 - Sounds: is broken down into series of numbers using a wave form. more bits= higher range of numbers= better sound.
