## Let's Git it Started
  **What is Git?**
   Git is a source control tool.
   A version-control system for tracking changes in source code.
   
   Version Control- A system that allows you to revisit various **versions** of a file or set of files by recording changes. You can change a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. Also, using a VCS (or Version Control System) a lot of mistakes can easily be fixed.
    

There are three different types of version control systems
 - Local
 - Centralized
 - Distributed

 Local entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

 Centralized entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, these can be assessed by various clients. This eliminated the need to involve all local databases and gave access for people to look at other files. Also, administrators were given more control over divvying up revision privileges.

 Distributed allows clients to make mirrored repos. This is to fix the issue with Centralized going down and a client losing any work, plus collaborators are unable to work with one another on a file or save changes and new versions. Distributed allows for multiple mirrored repos allowing programmers to work with one another in many ways to work on joint projects. This helps create many stimulous workflows.

 Don't get **Git and GitHub** confused!
  - Git is a version control system
  - GitHub is a website that provides hosting for software development and version control *USING* Git.
