Notes for Code 102d18.

## About me
My name is Alexandria. I am from Chatsworth, Georgia and currently just moved to Seattle to start my life over
and to start a career in Software Development.

### Growth Mindset in a nutshell
Growth Mindset to me is learning not to give up when things get hard and learn to work hard in every field i do. I need to
learn new things and learn how to overcome obstacles and not to be afraid to ask questions.
  If things got too hard for me, I was quick to give up and go for an easy route and BS my way through things so, growth mindset is putting my lazy side
behind me.

### Reminders for staying in a Growth Midset
- Keep focused and remind yourself it is ok to fail.
- Don't compare myself to others. It's ok to be a slower learner
- Don't be afraid to embrace the challenges I am up against. ***Don't run away when things get hard!***
