**Comparison and Logical Operators**

You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value to what you expect it to be.

Here are some different types of Boolean (or True or False) symbols used.

(also known as Comparison Operators)
 - == : Is Equal to
 - === : Strict Equal to
 - != : Is not equal to
 - !== : Strict is not equal to
 - (>) : Greater than
 - < : Less than
 - (>=) : Greater than or equal to
 - <= : Less than or equal to


Logical Operators allow you to compare results of more than one of the Comparison Operators.

Examples:
 - && : Logical And
 (tests more than one condition)
 - || : Logical Or
 (tests atleast one condition)
 - ! : Logical Not
 (takes a Boolean value and inverts it)

 **For and While loops**

  Loops check a condition.

  If the condition returns true then a code block will run. This will then repeat and check again and if it returns true again the code block will run again. It will keep repeating until the condition returns as False...

  There are three types of loops:
   - For : if you need to run code for a specific amount of times.
   - While : if you don't know how many times you would like the code to run
   - Do While : just like the While loop only it will run statements in the curly braces at least once even if the condition is false.

   Loop Counters 

   A FOR loop uses a counter as a condition. It instructs the code to run a certain amount of times
   The Condition is made up of three statements:
    - Initialization : create a variable and set to 0
    - Condition : loop continues to run until the counter reach a certain number.
    - Update : everytime the loop runs the statements, it adds one to the counter.
