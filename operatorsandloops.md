**Comparison and Logical Operators**

You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value to what you expect it to be.

Here are some different types of Boolean (or True or False) symbols used.

(also known as Comparison Operators)
 - == : Is Equal to
 - === : Strict Equal to
 - != : Is not equal to
 - !== : Strict is not equal to
 - (>) : Greater than
 - < : Less than
 - (>=) : Greater than or equal to
 - <= : Less than or equal to


Logical Operators allow you to compare results of more than one of the Comparison Operators.

Examples:
 - && : Logical And
 (tests more than one condition)
 - || : Logical Or
 (tests atleast one condition)
 - ! : Logical Not
 (takes a Boolean value and inverts it)
